# UNSHRED

Unshreds the shredded image from instagram's coding challenge, which is here: http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder.

161 lines of Javascript linted & commented, no external libraries.  Seems to work OK in chrome & ff, uses html5 canvas.
